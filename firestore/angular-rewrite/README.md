# FriendlyEatsQuickstart Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.

## Running the Application with Emulators

The command to start the project and run the local emulators is:
`firebase --project demo-friendly-eats emulators:exec --import./exported-firestore [--export-on-exit=./exported-firestore]`
(Only the `--export-on-exit` flag only if you want to persist changes after each run of the emulators. Otherwise, you will get a fresh dataset each execution.)

## Running the Angular App Only

Run `ng serve` to serve the Angular frontend without the emulated Firebase backend. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
